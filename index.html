    <h1>Jorge Herrera</h1>
    <p>I am an artists/graphic designer living and working in Boston, MA. I came here in 2010 to study art at the School of the Museum Fine Art and ended up getting my MFA from Tufts University in 2015. My art practice focus on personal identity in a globalized world. One that can become muddy in the relentless repetitions of daily modern life. I draw from personal histories, especially those who migrate and cross cultural as well as geographical borders. Across these borders, continuous repetition of information creates a sea of pop culture propaganda that is glossy, banal, and devoid of transcendent meaning. However my graphic design practice is much different. With graphic design I like the challenge of problem solving in a creative way, to communicate to people an important message or promote something important that will be understood and relatable to the public.</p>
